Malware Visualization with OSA_KDS

As the second part of our [IEEE access paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=JQsEaPUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=JQsEaPUAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C), following the [malware classification task](https://github.com/Djaferbenchadi/Malware_classification_ksm), this project introduces the Occlusion Sensitivity Analysis based Kernel Difference Subspace (OSA_KDS). 

Project 3, titled "Malware Visualization with OSA_KDS," focuses on the visualization framework for understanding malware behavior. This framework is essential for enhancing the interpretability of malware detection by generating saliency maps to visualize the importance of discriminative features within different malware families.
